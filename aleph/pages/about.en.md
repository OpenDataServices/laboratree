Aleph is a powerful tool for people who follow the money. It helps investigators to securely access and search large amounts of data - no matter whether they are a government database or a leaked email archive or PDFs from a Local Authority web portal.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.alephdata.org/) for more details.
